# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the delivery time of food orders for a food delivery service. The model takes into account various factors such as distance between the restaurant and the customer, the restaurant's cooking time, and the delivery partner's mode of transportation.

About Dataset
Food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.
